# GraficPlayground

**GraficPlayground** is a simple 3D graphics playground built with **Qt** and **OpenGL**. It allows for rendering 3D models, setting up scenes, experimenting with lighting, and handling basic interaction through keyboard and mouse events.

---

## ✅ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed before building:

- **QMake** version **3.1** or higher
- **Qt** version **5.15.13** or higher

---

## 🧪 How to Build and Run

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
qmake
make
./examen
```

## 🎮 What It Does

   - Loads and displays 3D models

   - Initializes custom 3D scenes

   - Sets up lighting via shaders

   - Handles movement and basic interaction

   - Syncs user events (keyboard, mouse) with the scene

   - Note: Due to limitations in model.cpp, models with textures (like many from https://www.models-resource.com/) will appear completely white.

## 📝 Notes

- The core logic of the application is in `MyGLWidget`, which inherits from `ExamGLWidget`.
- `ExamGLWidget` provides a basic OpenGL setup with a default (empty) scene.
- `MyGLWidget` extends it by:
  - Loading and rendering 3D models
  - Initializing custom scenes
  - Handling lighting via shaders
  - Managing input (keyboard, mouse)
  - Synchronizing events and animations
- Models are loaded from the `/model` folder using `model.cpp` and `model.h`.
- Textures are **not supported** due to limitations in `model.cpp`. As a result, many models (especially those from [The Models Resource](https://www.models-resource.com/)) appear white.

## 🕹️ User Guide

You control **Patricio** from *SpongeBob*. Here's how to interact with the scene:

### 🎥 Camera Controls
- `C` — Toggle Patricio's POV (also adjustable via "camera 2" in the UI)
- `Hold Left Click + Move Mouse` — Rotate the camera  
  (controls the scene if POV is off, or Patricio’s view direction if POV is on)

### 🧍 Movement Controls
- `W / A / S / D` — Move Patricio
- `SHIFT` — Toggle running mode
- `SPACE` — Jump
- `← / →` — Rotate Patricio left/right
- `↑ / ↓` — Change Patricio's Y-plane coordinate (also adjustable via "altura avió" in the UI)

### ✈️ Plane Controls
- `U` — Move Patricio’s plane one step in a circular motion
- `T` — Start the plane's automated route (circles around the hangar)
- `E` — Teleport Patricio to/from his plane

### 💡 Scene & Lighting
- `F` — Toggle light source between Sonic and Patricio’s plane
- `R` — Reset the scene and all parameters
